# ReqresAPItesting

Developed a framework for performing API Automation testing to automate https://reqres.in/ website using java REST Assured library in BDD( Behavior Driven Development) approach.

## Automated the following scenarios/requests:

    1. Get All Users (GET request)
    2. Get Single User Record (GET request)
    3. Create new User Record(POST request)
    4. Update the existing User Record(PUT request)
    5. Delete the User Record(DELETE request)

## Note:
* Here I have used java REST assured library for automating Restful Webservices.
 * Used testNG and BDD approach , added loggers, listeners etc.
 * Performed the validations like statuscode , statusline , responsetime , headers etc. 
 * I have also ran this project using maven/cmd and on jenkins. 

## Generated the Extent Reports:
